The game genie was used to rapidly showthe state of the technodrome rng. Two codes were used.</p><p>The first (AGKKKLIS) assigns the rng number to the starting world. When you press start, you will appear in world 3, 4, or 5, which correspond to hole 1, 2, or 3 respectively. Using it makes it possible to see the rng immediately, without playing through the game.</p><p>The second, two line code (SXEKAVOZ / TOEKPTAE) assigns the value of the in game frametimer to the subweapon count. Using it shows on which frame start was pressed.</p><p>The tests were done on 2 separate consoles, each gave similar results, though it is not guaranteed that your console will behave identically. That is one of the reasons that Iam sharing this data and testing method, To see if it is true that the randomization changes between consoles, and by how much.</p><h2 id="game-genie-codes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#game-genie-codes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Game Genie Codes</h2><p>The following codes are useful for testing RNG values.
